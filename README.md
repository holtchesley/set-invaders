# set-invaders

A cross between the card game Set, and the videogame Space Invaders

## Usage

Fire up a repl with `lein repl`, and `(require 'set-invaders.core)`

## Status

If I do finish this game, it'll probably be in an entirely different framework. I think Quil is pretty good for visualizations/exploring, but there are definitely better tools for games.
